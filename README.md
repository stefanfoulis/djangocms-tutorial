djangoCMS Tutorial - Step 3
===========================
In this part of the tutorial we're going to take a django app and modify it like that so we can use it in the CMS. We're gonna use the django-poll app.

You can either complete the tutorial here <https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/intro/tutorial01/> or copy and extract the zip `polls.zip` from `djangocms-tutorial/sources` to the project root.

You should end up with this structure:

```
do
```


bla bla

* extend page model
* menubar integration
* more?
