Stacks: displaying the same content on multiple locations
---------------------------------------------------------
If you need to display the same content on multiple locations you can use stacks.

Stacks have a name and a placeholder attached to them. There are 3 ways to use stacks.

### 1. Stack Template Tags	
You can use a template tag to display a placeholder in a template without the need for an actual placeholder on you models. This can be useful for:
	* Footer
	* Logo
	* Header
	* Text or content inside you app
	* Text or content inside of 3th party apps.
	
**Example:**
	
```python
{% load stack_tags %} {% stack "footer" %}
```
	
***Note:*** It is recommended to use stacks in your apphook apps instead of show_placeholder templatetags

### 2. Stack Plugins

You can create a stack out of plugins. You can create stacks out of plugin trees. After you created a stack this way you can insert a stack plugin and select a stack to be displayed instead of the stack plugin.

### 3. Stacks as templates

If you create stacks out of plugin tree you can paste the plugins contained in a stack as template. For example you can create a teaser plugin tree out of a multicolumn, text and picture plugin. You can then paste this template at the appropriate place and just edit the plugins instead of creating the same structure over and over.
